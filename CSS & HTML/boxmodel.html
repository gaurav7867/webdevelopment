        <p>I am a wooden material and I am popular for my brown colour. I am very close to the hands of player. Can you guess me who I am. I am your most important demand of childhood. I am a cricket bat.
            I was in a toy shop for long time. Many children came to that shop. Many of them touched me and also hold me but due to my high cost, they used to leave me. I was getting bore in the shop. 
            I was much excited to get someone's friendship, who can take me out from this shop. I did not want to lie in this boring shop anymore.
            One day a handsome boy named Sunil came to the shop. He straight came to me and asked to the shopkeeper that he wanted me. The shopkeeper told to see more bats of the shop. But Sunil did not listen him and asked my price. In one take he paid my price and took me out of that jail.
            I felt much happy to breath fresh air of outside world.</p>
